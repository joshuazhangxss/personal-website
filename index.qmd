I’m an undergraduate Statistics & Data Science student at UCLA who loves turning messy data
into clear stories and useful tools. Outside of class, I run an Amazon e-commerce business,
manage an Airbnb, and build data-driven dashboards and models for real-world problems.

When I’m not debugging R or Python, you can probably find me playing basketball, practicing
piano or guitar, or testing a new 3D-printed idea.
