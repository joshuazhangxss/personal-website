This project studies how everyday student habits—like study time, sleep,
screen use, and well-being—relate to exam performance. We use a Kaggle dataset
of **1,000 students** with behavioral and demographic variables and build a
regression model to quantify which habits matter most for grades.

## 🎯 Goal & Research Question

- **Goal:** Understand how student lifestyle habits relate to academic success.  

- **Research question:**  
  > “How do study time, sleep, screen use, and other daily habits affect exam scores?”

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: Kaggle “Student Habits vs Academic Performance” dataset.  

- **Sample size:** 1,000 students  
- **Structure:** 16 columns, including:   
  - `study_hours_per_day`  
  - `sleep_hours`  
  - `social_media_hours`, `netflix_hours`  
  - `exercise_frequency`  
  - `attendance_percentage`  
  - `diet_quality`, `mental_health_rating`  
  - `exam_score` (target)  
- **Pre-processing in R:** 
  - Removed `student_id`  
  - Converted character variables to factors  
  - Checked for missing values

## 🔧 Methods

We modeled **exam_score** using multiple linear regression.    

- Started with all **15** behavioral and demographic predictors.   
- Used **stepwise selection (stepAIC)** to remove insignificant variables and avoid overfitting.  
- Final model kept **7 significant predictors:**  
  - `study_hours_per_day`  
  - `sleep_hours`  
  - `attendance_percentage`  
  - `exercise_frequency`  
  - `mental_health_rating`  
  - `social_media_hours` (negative effect)  
  - `netflix_hours` (negative effect)  
- Tools: R (`lm`, `MASS::stepAIC`, `broom`, `ggplot2`).

## 📈 Model Performance & Effects

From the final regression model: 

- **Adjusted R² ≈ 0.90** – the model explains about 90% of the variance in exam scores.  
- All predictors in the final model are highly significant (*p* < 0.001).  
- Largest effect sizes:  
  - **+9.57** exam points per additional hour of study time per day  
  - **–2.62** exam points per additional hour of social media use  
  - **–2.28** exam points per additional hour of Netflix use  
- Positive but smaller contributors:  
  - Higher attendance, more sleep, more exercise, and better mental-health ratings all contribute modestly to higher scores.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Study time is the strongest positive driver** of exam performance.  
- **Sleep and mental health matter**—students who sleep more and rate their
  mental health higher tend to do better.  
- **Screen time works against performance**, especially social media and Netflix.  
- Attendance and exercise have smaller but still positive effects.

## ✅ Practical Advice for Students

Based on our model and exploratory analysis:  
- Boost structured **study hours**—even 1 extra focused hour a day has a big payoff.  
- Aim for **7–8 hours of sleep** to support both grades and mental health.  
- Stay **physically active**, even in small amounts.  
- Be intentional with **screen time**, especially social media and streaming.  
- Maintain **consistent attendance** and prioritize your mental well-being.
